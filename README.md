> **Figure 1.** Current featurizers use *directions* as primitives — the SAE on the right renders the rabbit's ears and face as two such directions. The BSF lifts the primitive from directions to *regions of activation space*, recovering the ear and face concepts as manifolds whose internal coordinate (hue heatmap) reports where within the concept a given activation lies. The face concept resolves into fine-grained facial features (left/right of nose and eyes), while the ear feature varies smoothly along the rabbit's ear.

## What is a Block-Sparse Featurizer?

Standard sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural representations into sparse sums of **directions** — one atom per concept. But recent work shows that concepts in vision models are often realized as **low-dimensional subspaces and manifolds**, not single directions. A SAE applied to such a manifold is forced to tile it with many separate atoms, fragmenting what should be a single coherent concept.

**Block-Sparse Featurizers (BSFs)** attempt to adress this by lifting the unit of sparsity from individual directions to **blocks** — small groups of directions spanning a subspace. This is motivated by a generative model in which each activation is a sparse sum of points drawn from low-dimensional manifolds (an *additive mixture of manifolds*). The natural Bayesian prior for this model is block sparsity: sparse *across* concepts, dense *within* each active concept.

A BSF code carries two quantities per concept where a SAE carries only one:

| Quantity | Meaning | Visualization |
|---|---|---|
| `‖z_g‖₂` (block norm) | How strongly the concept is present | Single-color heatmap, like a SAE |
| `z_g` (block coordinate) | *Where* within the concept the activation lies | Hue map (first 3 PCA axes → RGB) |

The internal coordinate is precisely what SAEs discard — it is what gives BSFs their ability to recover concept manifolds and their intrinsic geometry.

## Three Featurizer Variants

| Featurizer | Encoder | Sparsity mechanism | Decoder |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vanilla BSF** | Free linear `(W, b)` | Block TopK (keep `l0` blocks of largest norm) | Free `D` |
| **Grassmannian BSF** | Tied: `z_g = γ · x Dg^T` | Block TopK | Orthonormal frames `Dg Dg^T = I` |
| **Group Lasso BSF** | Free linear `(W, b)` | Block soft-threshold `sh_θ` | Free `D` |

All three subclass `bsf.BSF` and share a single interface (`encode` / `loss` / decoder), so one trainer and one visualizer work for all of them.

## Quickstart

```python
import bsf, numpy as np, torch, einops
from bsf import data

# Load 300 rabbit images and compute DINOv3 patch activations (GPU needed)
images = data.load_rabbit_images('rabbit.npz')
acts   = data.dino_activations(images)          # (300, 196, 768)

# Center and scale
acts = acts - data.POS_MEAN
x    = einops.rearrange(acts, 'n p d -> (n p) d')
x    = x / np.sqrt((x ** 2).sum(1).mean()) * np.sqrt(x.shape[1])
grid = data.patch_grid(acts.shape[1])           # 14

# Train a Grassmannian BSF with 3D blocks
model = bsf.GrassmannianBSF(d=768, n_groups=256, group_size=3, l0=16)
bsf.train(model, x, epochs=60)

# Encode and visualize top concepts
z     = model.encode(torch.as_tensor(x, dtype=torch.float32, device='cuda')).detach().cpu().numpy()
atoms = model.atoms().cpu().numpy()
heat  = np.linalg.norm(z, axis=-1)
fire, energy = (heat > 1e-6).sum(0), (heat ** 2).sum(0)
top   = [g for g in np.argsort(-energy) if fire[g] >= 100][:20]

bsf.viz.plot_concepts(z, atoms, images, top, grid, n_img=10)
```

## Concept Dashboard

Explore what a trained featurizer learned. `bsf analyze` builds one
self-contained artifact; `bsf dashboard` serves an interactive Dash app over it.

```bash
pip install "bsf[dashboard]"

bsf analyze --ckpt runs/gl_l32.pt --data /captures/pile25m \
    --layer 32 --hook post_block --n-groups 4096 --group-size 4 \
    --gguf ~/Models/Model.gguf --requests 300 --out runs/analysis_l32.npz

bsf dashboard --analysis runs/analysis_l32.npz --port 8050
# remote:  ssh -L 8050:localhost:8050 <host>
```

Four linked views, all following one selected concept: a **concept map** (spectral
layout of the strong co-activation graph), **top-activating tokens** in context,
the concept's **3D firing manifold**, and ranked **subspace / co-firing
relations** with firing-rate statistics.

Note on the map: a BSF concept is a `group_size`-dim *subspace*, so relations are
chordal distances between subspaces. But an overcomplete dictionary
(`n_groups*group_size > d`) forces those subspaces near-orthogonal — measured on a
4096x4 dictionary at d=5120, the median pairwise distance is 1.9971 of a maximum
2.0 and two dimensions capture only 0.63% of the variance. So the map lays out the
*co-activation graph* instead, where the structure actually is, while chordal
distance is kept for the nearest-neighbour lists (its tail is where near-duplicate
concepts live). See [`docs/features/concept_dashboard.md`](docs/features/concept_dashboard.md).

Reading an artifact needs only numpy + plotly + dash — no torch, no GPU, no access
to the original captures.

## Notebooks

Three end-to-end starter notebooks, one per featurizer variant:

| Notebook | Featurizer |
|---|---|
| [`starters/01_grassmannian.ipynb`](starters/01_grassmannian.ipynb) | Grassmannian BSF |
| [`starters/02_group_lasso.ipynb`](starters/02_group_lasso.ipynb) | Group Lasso BSF |
| [`starters/03_vanilla.ipynb`](starters/03_vanilla.ipynb) | Vanilla BSF |

Each notebook locates the repo root automatically and runs end-to-end. Computing DINOv3 activations requires a GPU; training and plotting run on CPU.
